## Overview

This is the desktop version of a website developed for a food truck based in San Francisco. I was tasked with creating the website based off of the design using React. 

Special thanks to Ux/Ui designer [Jacob Difede](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-difede-434955221/) for designing such an amazing website and for providing me with all the details and files in Figma I needed to hit the ground running. 

### The Challenge

- Develop a website using React based off a design given to me by Jacob.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS 
- CSS Flex Box
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [react-responsive-carousel](http://react-responsive-carousel.js.org/)

### What I learned

Working with a Ux/Ui designer enabled me to see the website from the user perspective.  I also learned how valuable Figma can be to not only the designer but to a developer, especially in a collaborative setting.  
Even though I used an npm package for the carousel, I had to learn how to target different HTML elements within that component to customize the look of it using CSS.
